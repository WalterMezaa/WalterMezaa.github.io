If you’ve forgotten your Google login information, you will need to reset your password or recover your account.\nFactory Settings: Once you have your Google account information, you can reset your Android phone to the factory settings. In order to do this, IT professionals recommend going to “Settings”, then “System”, followed by “Reset Options” and then “Factory Data Reset.” Once this is done, your phone will be reverted to its original settings without the need for a password.\nStep by Step Guide to Reset Android to Factory Settings Without Password Reset Android Factory Settings Quick and Easy Way to Reset Android Without Password Reset Your Android Device to Factory Settings Without Password Reset using Google Account: This is the easiest and the most popular method to reset an Android device.

In either of these cases, the Android Device Manager will be used to locate the device, erase the password or reset the device to its factory settings.

Possible Issues Faced When Resetting Your Android Device When using Android Device Manager (ADM) to reset your device, you may face some possible issues.

Another issue is that ADM has no advanced security features, so if someone else has access to it, they may be able to reset it. Lastly, if you are unable to sign in to your Google Account, then ADM won’t be able to reset the device.\nIn addition, if you try to use Google Accounts to reset your Android device, it usually takes a certain amount of time to reactivate your device, depending on the complexity of the password. If the password is too complex, the process takes longer. Also, if certain security features are enabled on the device, it can take longer than usual to restore your device.\n4.
