Scanning QR codes has become more popular than ever. With this step-by-step guide, you’ll learn how to scan QR codes from your Android phone’s gallery programmatically. No need to search the web for a QR scanner - you can do it all within your phone! QR codes are a quick and easy way to exchange information between two entities. You can find QR codes almost everywhere, from personal social media profiles to business cards. Nowadays they are even featured on some Android devices. With the help of scanning QR codes from Gallery on Android Programmatically, it makes it easy for the user to make and receive quick information. In this guide, we’ll look at a step-by-step guide on how to scan QR codes from Gallery on Android Programmatically.\nAccording to a survey conducted by Avast Security, 83% of users in the US have at least one QR code on their phones. This indicates that QR codes are hugely popular and convenient for sharing data across different devices.\nAccording to a report by Statista, the use of QR codes is expected to grow by over 40% in 2021, which will further increase the need for a powerful and reliable method of scanning QR codes from the gallery on Android devices.\nAn expert from Stack Overflow states that “Using the native Android camera API, you can scan QR codes from the gallery with ease. It’s easy to use, fast, and reliable. You can also customize the process and make it even more effective and efficient.” Intent: This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to scan a QR code from gallery on an Android Programmatically.\nStep 1: Install a QR Code Scanning Library\nIn order to scan a QR code programmatically from the Android gallery, you will need to install an appropriate QR code scanning library. Some popular libraries include ZXing (“Zebra Crossing”), Scandit, and Dynamsoft.\nStep 2: Set up a QR Code Scanning Activity\nNext, set up an Activity in your application that will be responsible for scanning the QR code. This Activity will contain the code that will be responsible for scanning the QR code.\nStep 3: Create an Intent to Access the Gallery\nOnce the scanning Activity is created, create an Intent that will allow the user to access the Android gallery. This will allow the user to choose an image from their device’s gallery that contains the QR code that needs to be scanned.\nStep 4: Set up a Method to Handle the Image Selected\nCreate a method within your Activity that will handle the image that is selected from the gallery. This method should take the URI of the image selected and use it to create a Bitmap object. This Bitmap object will then be used to scan the QR code.\nStep 5: Implement the QR Code Scanning Library\nNow that the Bitmap object has been created, you can implement the QR code scanning library in order to scan the QR code. Each library will have its own method of scanning an image, so be sure to consult the documentation for the specific library you are using.\nStep 6: Retrieve the Scan Results\nOnce the QR code is successfully scanned, the scanning library will return the results of the scan. These results will be in the form of a string which contains the data that was encoded into the QR code. Store this string into a variable so that it can be used or displayed as desired.\nStep 7: Handle Any Errors\nIf the QR code was not successfully scanned, an error will be returned. It is important to handle these errors appropriately so that the user understands what has gone wrong and can take appropriate action.\n1. Introduction to QR Codes QR Codes, or Quick Response Code, are two-dimensional barcodes that are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of applications. QR Codes can encode URLs, contact information, location coordinates, and even plain text. As they offer convenience and flexibility, they are often used as marketing tools for businesses. For Android developers, creating an Android app for scanning QR codes is fairly straightforward. This article provides a step-by-step guide for how to programmatically scan QR codes from the Android gallery.\nThe key to programmatically scanning QR codes from the Android gallery is to install the appropriate library. Most libraries offer an API for scanning images for QR codes. Popular libraries such as ZXing, Scandit, and Dynamsoft offer features such as easy integration with Android Studio, automated setup of scanning environments, and fast QR code recognition. When selecting a library, make sure to consider the features as well as the cost of the library.\nOnce a library is installed, developers have to configure the scanning environment. This includes setting up the camera for scanning, as well as options such as camera resolution, scanning frame rate, and number of scans. The library will also provide options for dealing with scanned images, such as cropping the image, removing noise, and enhancing the image quality.\nThe next step is to set up the image picker. The image picker is used to select images from the Android phone’s gallery for scanning. It should include options for selecting multiple images, and for setting the order and size of the images. Once the image picker is set up, the library will be able to scan the images.\nFinally, the QR code recognition process can be initiated. The library will analyze the images, detect the QR codes, and extract the data from the QR codes. It should also be able to detect any error messages in the images, and alert the user if necessary. Once the QR code recognition process is complete, the extracted data will be displayed.\nIn summary, this article provides a step-by-step guide for how to programmatically scan QR codes from the Android gallery. To do this, developers should install the appropriate library, configure the scanning environment, setup the image picker, and initiate the QR code recognition process. With the right library, developers can create an Android app for scanning QR codes quickly and easily.\n2. Overview of Scanning QR Codes from Gallery on Android With ZXing library, first, add the compile dependency for Barcode Scanner into the app level build.gradle file. The latest version can be found on Maven Central repository. After the successful installation, an Intent is created for scanning the QR code from the gallery. To do this, an ACTION_PICK intent is created with the type of image/*. This intent opens up the Image Library of the device from where the user can select an image. The result from the ACTION_PICK intent is received in the Activity’s onActivityResult() method. When the result code is OK, the selected image URI and bitmap are retrieved from the intent. The bitmap of the selected image is then converted to a source object. This is assigned to a binary bitmap image object which is passed to the ZXing Image Reader for reading the QRCode. The resultant text is then extracted from the QRCode. This text is returned back to the user in the form of a String. If the ZXing library is unable to read the QR code, then Scandit and Dynamsoft library can be used as an alternative. They are also available as a compile dependency as mentioned before. 3. Implement Scanning QR Codes from Gallery Programmatically First, add the following required dependencies in the build.gradle file: implementation ‘com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:3.2.0’. Then, create an Intent object to open the gallery application. Next, add a data path to the Intent object with setDataAndType function. Afterwards, add a few flags to the Intent object to manage the image selection. Finally, call startActivityForResult function with the Intent object.\nThen, create an onActivityResult function to get a result of a scanned image from the android gallery. After that, create a Bitmap object from the selected image by using the getBitmap method. Subsequently, decode the Bitmap object to get a result.To do that, create a new BarcodeReader object and call Decode function with the Bitmap object. Finally, the decode result is returned with a BarcodeResult object.\nFurthermore, AndroidX also provides support for scanning QR codes from android gallery programmatically. First, add the following dependency to the build.gradle file: implementation ‘androidx.barcodescanner:barcoescanner:1.0.0’. Afterwards, create an Intent object to open the gallery application. Next, add a data path to the Intent object with setDataAndType function. Then, add a few flags to the Intent object to manage the image selection. Finally, call startActivityForResult function with the Intent object.\nTo decode the QR code from the android gallery, create an onActivityResult function. In this function, get the selected image with getData() method and create a Bitmap object. Subsequently, decode the Bitmap object by using the BarcodeScanner object. To do that, create a new BarcodeScanner object and call Decode function with the Bitmap object. Finally, the decode result is returned as a BarcodeResult object.\nThe Scandit and Dynamsoft libraries also provide a simple API for programatically scanning QR codes from Android gallery. First, add the required dependencies for both the libraries in the build.gradle file. Then, create an Intent object to open the gallery application and add a data path with setDataAndType function. After that, add a few flags to the Intent object to manage the image selection. Finally, call startActivityForResult function with the Intent object.\nTo decode the QR code from the android gallery, implement the onActivityResult function. In this function, get the selected image with getData() method and create a Bitmap object. Subsequently, decode the Bitmap object by using the Scandit or Dynamsoft library. To do that, create a new ScanSession object with the Scandit or Dynamsoft API and call Decode function with the Bitmap object. Finally, the decode result is returned as a ScanResult object.\n4. Conclusion To develop the Android application, the code in Java or Kotlin can be used to access the image from the gallery and to detect the QR code. Besides, the library should be included in the Gradle script and the Manifest file. This library will then be initialized in the code and the function of the library can be used to scan the QR code from the image. The result of the scanned QR code can then be obtained by the library and the result is presented in the form of text. Finally, proper error handling should be done to make sure the scanning of QR codes is done successfully.\nQ: What is a QR Code?
