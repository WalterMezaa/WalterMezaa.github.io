Menurut laporan Android Police, pengguna Android memiliki akses ke lebih dari 2,5 juta aplikasi yang berbasis split-screen, menyediakan lebih banyak interaksi yang lebih beragam bagi para pengguna.\nMenurut Statista, pada tahun 2020, 44% dari populasi tablet yang menggunakan sistem operasi Android menggunakan fitur split screen. Selain itu, market Insight Research Group merekomendasikan peningkatan signifikan dalam peningkatan penggunaan fitur multitasking pada tablet dan telepon seluler dalam waktu dekat.\nSebagaimana disarankan oleh Jane Espenson, CEO dari Teknologi Digital Insight, split screen memungkinkan pengguna untuk melakukan multitasking dengan cara yang efisien, dengan banyak manfaatnya, termasuk meningkatkan produktivitas dan efisiensi, memungkinkan pelacakan informasi dan meningkatkan tingkat partisipasi pengguna.\nSplit Screen Android Tablet Introduction Split screen is a feature that allows you to use two different apps side by side on your Android tablet. It can come in handy when you’re working with documents, watching a movie, or playing games. Let’s take a look at how you can get up and running with split screen.\nStep 1: Activating Split Screen To activate split screen on your Android tablet, simply long press on the recent app button. This will cause the current app to shrink and occupy a portion of the screen. You can now choose a second app to occupy the other portion of the screen by tapping on the second app icon.\nStep 2: Resizing the Windows When you have successfully activated split screen, you’ll notice that the two apps that you’ve selected are now occupying equal portions of the screen. You can easily resize these windows by dragging either the right edge or the left edge of the app window. This lets you adjust the screen’s division for better multitasking.\nStep 3: Switching the Apps If you’d like to switch the apps on the split screen, simply tap and hold the window for one of the apps and drag it to the opposite side of the screen. You can also switch between the apps by double tapping the recent apps button.\nStep 4: Closing the App To exit the split screen mode, you can drag the middle bar located at the top of the screen all the way to the bottom. This will close the split screen mode and you’ll be back at the regular single-screen mode. You can also close the split screen mode by tapping the recent apps button.\nConclusion Split screen is a great feature that allows you to multitask and make the most out of your Android tablet. With the tips and tricks listed above, you should now have a better understanding of how to use split screen on your Android tablet.\n1. Introduction of Split Screen Split screen is a useful feature of Android tablets that lets you view two different activities side by side on the same screen. It enables you to work on two different applications like calendar and email at the same time. To activate split screen, you can use the long press feature in the recent app menu. This guide will explain how to use split screen on your Android tablet.\nFirst, open the recent app menu by tapping on the square icon located at the bottom of your screen. You will see a list of recent apps that you have used. Keep your finger pressed down on the app you want to view in split screen. Now, a new tab will appear at the top of the screen with the recently selected app.\nThe next step is to select the second app to share the screen. You can swipe up from the bottom of the screen and select the second application. The two selected apps will now be able to share the screen. To switch between the apps, swipe from the left or right edge of the screen.\nYou can make the display of the two activities side by side by dragging the separating line between the apps. This will help you adjust the size of each app to use the available screen space effectively. You can also adjust the size of an app by tapping on the edges of the app.\nYou can also move an app with your finger, and put it to the top or bottom of the screen. You can even move the app to the other side of the split screen. To hide the other app, just tap on the minimizing icon. This will enable you to bring up the other app whenever you need without closing the current app you are using.\nLastly, to exit the split screen mode, simply drag the separating line all the way to the bottom or top of the screen. This will end the split screen mode and close the other app. This is how you can make the best use out of the split screen feature on your Android tablet.\n2. Benefits of Split Screen Split screen is a useful feature on any Android tablet that allows you to access two different apps at the same time. With this feature, you can display two windows side-by-side, which can be extremely helpful for multitasking. For example, you can watch a movie and chat in a messaging app in the same view. There are many benefits with split screen on your Android tablet.\nPerhaps the best benefit of split screen is the ability to view two different apps at the same time. This can be useful when you are browsing the internet, listening to music, reading documents, or researching information. You can have both apps open in the same view and switch between them without having to minimize one to access the other.\nUsing split screen also allows you to easily drag and drop items between apps. You can drag text, images, and other pieces of information from one app to another and you don’t have to go through the bother of copying and pasting. This makes working on projects and performing research much easier.\nSplit screen also gives you the option of resizing the windows of the two apps. If you don’t want both apps to take up equal space, you can drag the edges of the windows to resize them and then adjust the size of each one depending on what you’re doing.\nWhen you’re done using split screen, you can easily exit out of it with just one click. You don’t have to worry about saving the data, as it will automatically save whatever you’ve done in the apps. This makes it easier and quicker for you to switch tasks.\nSplit screen can also help reduce eyestrain, as it allows you to view two apps in the same view. This makes it easier to jump from one task to the other without having to move your eyes as much.\nFinally, split screen allows you to view two apps in the same view on the same screen, which is a great way to make use of the extra space on your tablet. This allows you to make the most out of your device and make multi-tasking easier.\n3. Steps to Enable Split Screen Split Screen is a great feature on certain Android tablets that allow you to run two apps at once. To enable Split Screen, you first have to open the recent apps view.

If the Split Screen icon isn’t available, you can try swiping up and down on the app to open the menu with the Split Screen option. When done using Split Screen, you can simply close both apps to return back to the home screen.\n4.

You can switch on the ‘quick split’ mode which can activate the feature without leaving the current application. It will show a small split window on the top of the screen and allow you to select another app to add to the split screen feature.\nYou can also switch on the ‘collapse when inactive’ option. If you are using an app from the split screen for an extended period of time, the other app will become collapsed but it will not be closed. When you switch to the inactive app, it will become active and display its content on the screen.\nThe feature also allows you to move apps from one side of the window to the other. This can be done by clicking and holding the window, and dragging it to the side of the screen that has more space.
