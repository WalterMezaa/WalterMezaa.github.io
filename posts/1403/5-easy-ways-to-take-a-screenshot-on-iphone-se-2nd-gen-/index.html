Look no further! We’ve compiled five easy steps to take the perfect screenshots on your device, no matter your level of tech-savviness!

So, let’s get started and learn how to capture an image with a single click!\nAccording to Apple, the new “Home” button on the 2nd Gen iPhone SE makes taking a screenshot as easy as: pressing the “side” and “volume up” buttons at the same time. With this method, users can capture whatever is being displayed on their phone, from conversations to maps, quickly and easily.\nAnother way to take a screenshot on the 2nd Gen iPhone SE is to use the built-in AssistiveTouch feature. With AssistiveTouch, users can access a menu of shortcuts that can be used to open the Control Center, access Siri, and take screenshots. It’s a great way for users to be able to take screenshots without having to use the physical buttons.\nExperts recommend the use of third-party apps to make taking screenshots even easier. Apps such as Apowersoft Screenshot app and Tailor make taking screenshots a breeze and offer additional features like the ability to annotate, crop, or even record the screen.\nTake Screenshots iPhone SE\nTaking a Screenshot using Buttons: Press and hold down the “Home” button and the “Sleep/Wake” button simultaneously on the right side of the iPhone SE 2nd Gen.\nTaking a Screenshot using Assistive Touch: Go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Accessibility \u003e AssistiveTouch and turn on “AssistiveTouch”. Navigate to the AssistiveTouch menu and tap “Device \u003e More \u003e Screenshot”.\nTaking a Screenshot using Siri: Say “Hey Siri, take a screenshot”, and Siri will take a screenshot of what is currently on the screen.\nTaking a Screenshot using Apple Pencil (2nd Gen): If you have an Apple Pencil (2nd Gen), you can double-tap the Pencil on the lock screen of your iPhone SE 2nd Gen to take a screenshot.\nTaking a Screenshot with the 3D Touch App Switcher: Press and hold down the “Home” and the “Sleep/Wake” buttons simultaneously for a few seconds and then release.
