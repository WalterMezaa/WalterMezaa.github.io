According to Microsoft, users can “capture all or part of your PC screen, add notes, save the snip, or email it from the Snipping Tool window”.\nThis feature makes it simple for users to capture screenshots quickly and without any additional third-party tools installed, allowing them to capture and share a screenshot quickly.\nTake Screenshot Lenovo Win10 Step-by-Step Guide on How to Take a Screenshot on a Lenovo Laptop Windows 10 Taking screenshots on your Lenovo laptop is a great way to capture what’s on your screen. Whether you’re sharing a screenshot with a colleague, documenting the graphics of a game you’re playing, or preserving information for a project, this step-by-step guide will help you quickly take a screenshot on your Lenovo laptop running Windows 10.\nMethod 1: Take a quick screenshot with the Print Screen key\nFind the Print Screen key on your keyboard. This key is often abbreviated as “PrtSc” and is located at the top-right corner of your keyboard. Pressing this key will take a snapshot of your entire screen and save it to your clipboard.\nOpen an image editing program such as Microsoft Paint or Paint 3D. You can find these programs by going to the Windows search bar.\nPaste the screenshot to the image editor. To do this, click on the “Paste” icon in the top menu bar, or press “Ctrl” + “V” keys on the keyboard.\nResize, crop, or edit the screenshot as needed.\nSave the image file with the desired title and file format.\nMethod 2: Take a selective screenshot with the Snipping Tool\nOpen the Snipping Tool program by going to the Windows search bar and typing “Snipping Tool”.\nSelect the type of screenshot you want to take. You can choose to take a rectangular snip, a free-form snip, a window snip, or a full-screen snip.\nOnce you have the desired area of your screen selected, the snip will open in a new window. You can edit it, add annotations, or share it with someone directly from the Snipping Tool window.\nIf you’d like to save the image, go to the “File” menu and select “Save As”. Then, choose a file name and the desired file format before clicking “Save”.\n1. What is Screenshot A screenshot is an image captured of your computer or laptop’s screen. It is also known as a print screen or screengrab. This type of image can be used to show error messages or show a colleague a view of your screen. Taking screenshots on a Lenovo laptop running Windows 10 is easy to do and this guide will show you the different ways you can get your desired screenshot.\nThe most convenient way to take a screenshot is by using the Windows + PrtScn keyboard shortcut.

Snagit is a great tool that allows you to capture an individual window, a region of the screen, or the entire screen. This application also allows you to edit and enhance your screenshots and create arrows and text boxes to emphasize important details.\nScreenshots are a great way to capture what’s on your screen and can be used to help colleagues, friends, and family with their computer related issues.
