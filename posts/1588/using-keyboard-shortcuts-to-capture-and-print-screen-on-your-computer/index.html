Keyboard shortcuts provide a quick and efficient way to take screenshots of images and portions of your screen. Knowing the shortcuts can help you save time and easily capture anything you need on your computer screen.\nTo capture your entire PC screen with a single keystroke, press the Windows logo key + PrtScn (Print Screen).\nThe screenshot will then be saved to the Photos/Screenshots folder in your Pictures library.\nTo capture only the active window, press Alt+PrtScn. This will take a screenshot of the active window and copy it to the clipboard. You can then paste it into your favorite image editor or document editor.\nOn some keyboards, the PrtScn key is paired with another key. If pressing PrtScn doesn’t work, try pressing Fn+PrtScn, Fn+Windows logo key+PrtScn, or Fn+Alt+PrtScn.\nYou can also use the Snipping Tool to select a specific area of the screen before you take the screenshot. To open the Snipping Tool, press the Windows logo key + Shift + S.\nWhen you’re ready to print, open the screenshot in an image editor, like the Photos app. Then, press Ctrl+P to open the Print dialog box. Make sure your printer is connected, select your desired settings, and click Print.\nUsing keyboard shortcuts to capture and print screen on your computer is a great way to save time and get the job done quickly.

Explain the basic tools for capturing and printing a screen Capturing a screenshot is an easy task and can be accomplished with the right tools and a few simple key presses. One of the best and quickest ways to capture the screen is with the keyboard shortcut PrtScn (Print Screen). Pressing this key will capture the entire screen regardless of window size. It will capture the parts of a window that extend beyond the edge of the screen. If you are looking to capture just the application currently in use, the shortcut Alt + PrtScn will do the trick. Additionally, if you want to capture a specific window or area of the screen you can press Windows key + Shift + S to capture a specific portion.\nOnce you have narrowed down your selection and captured the desired screenshot, it’s time to print. The quickest way to print is by pressing CTRL + PrtScn for PCs. This will instantly print the image to the print screen device you have connected to your computer. For Mac users, the command Shift + Command + 4 will let you capture a specific portion of the screen and save it to your desktop. You can then easily print it out from the desktop.\nThe keyboard shortcuts mentioned are only the basic shortcuts for capturing and printing your screen but there are other tools that allow you to customize how you capture and print screenshots. These tools can offer you more versatile options such as timed captures and cropping options. If you are looking for more detailed pictures and videos, specialized screen capture tools and applications are available.\n2.

This means that you can capture all of the windows you have open, as well as any other elements that are on your desktop. Once you have pressed the PrtScn key, the image will be stored in the clipboard of your computer, ready for you to paste into any image editor.\nThe Alt + PrtScn keys allow you to capture just the active window of your computer. This means that you will only capture the window that you are currently working on, instead of all of the windows you have open. Once you have pressed the Alt + PrtScn keys, the image will be stored in the clipboard of your computer, ready for you to paste into any image editor.\nAn alternative way to capture and print your screen is by using the Ctrl + PrtScn keys. This shortcut will allow you to capture just the currently active window of your computer, but it will also save the image directly to your hard drive. You can then locate the image in the folder My Pictures\nFinally, if you need to capture something specific from your computer screen, such as a text or image, you can use the Window + Shift + S shortcut. This will allow you to capture just the selected area, without capturing any of the other elements on the screen. Once you have pressed the shortcut, the image will be stored in the clipboard, ready to be pasted into an image editor.\nBy learning these keyboard shortcuts, you can easily and quickly capture and print any screen from your computer. Whether you need to capture the entire screen or just a specific element, these keyboard shortcuts are a great way to save you both time and effort.\n3. Explain the steps of printing the captured screen After pressing the PrtScn button, the screenshot will be saved in the clipboard.

When you press the PrtScn button, a copy of the screenshot will be saved in the Pictures folder. You can open the captured screenshots in the Pictures folder and then print them.\nFinally, you can also use a third-party screenshot capture tool such as Snagit to capture screenshots and print them.

Outline the best practices when using the capturing and printing feature To save even more time, turn on the toggle switch under the Print Screen button. You can then press the Alt + PrtScn shortcut to take a screenshot of the active window without needing to manually save the file.\nAnother helpful trick is to use the Windows Key + PrtScn shortcut to capture the entire screen and save it as a file without needing to manually open a photo-editing app. This shortcut will store the file in the Screenshots folder on your PC.\nYou can also use the Windows Key + Shift + S to take a custom screenshot.
