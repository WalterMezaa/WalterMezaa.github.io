Let’s take a look at how to use Print Screen and the Snipping Tool in Windows 8.1.</p><p>To start, press the Windows Key + PrtScn on your keyboard to take a screenshot. The screenshot will be saved to your PC in the Screenshots folder, which you can find in the Pictures library. Once saved, you can edit it in an image editing program or share it with others.</p><p>If you want to capture parts of your screen, the Snipping Tool is the way to go. To access the tool, type snipping tool in the Start Menu and select the program. You&rsquo;ll be presented with several options such as free-form, rectangular, window, or full-screen snip. Select the one you want and the screen will dim. Drag your mouse to capture the area you want and the snip will be saved to your PC.</p><p>If you need to annotate your screenshots, you can use the built-in Windows 8.1 snapshot feature. After taking a screenshot, click the pen icon that appears at the top of the screen. You can use the various tools provided to highlight, add text or draw on the image.</p><p>Finally, keep in mind that you can also use the Print Screen feature to copy an image to your clipboard. To do this, press the Alt + PrtScn buttons on your keyboard. This will copy the image to your clipboard, so you can paste it into a document or an image editor.</p><p>With the Print Screen and Snipping Tool in Windows 8.1, you can easily take screenshots of your computer screen and annotate them as needed.</p><h2 id=4-troubleshooting-common-problems-on-the-print-screen-feature-in-windows-81>4.
