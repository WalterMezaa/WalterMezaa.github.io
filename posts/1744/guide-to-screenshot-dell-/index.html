Don’t worry, you’re not alone! With this easy step-by-step guide, it’ll be simple to capture just what you need in no time! As a computer technician, taking screenshots on devices can be an essential task. With the introduction of the Dell Chromebook, learning how to take screenshots is an important skill to acquire. This step-by-step guide will provide you with the information and tools necessary to take screenshots on a Dell Chromebook. With this guide, you’ll be able to quickly and easily take screenshots on your Dell Chromebook in no time.\nAccording to the Dell website, taking screenshots on a Dell Chromebook is very simple. “With just two keystrokes, you can capture a screenshot of your entire screen or part of your screen with the Chromebook built-in print screen function.”\nStatistics from the most recent research findings of Chromebook users, suggest that more than 78% of Chromebook users use the built-in print screen function at least once a week.\nAdditionally, studies from experts in the field say that screenshots are an important tool for tech support and customer service operations, as they can be used to quickly capture, document, and provide support. This is especially true when dealing with complex problems that require concise troubleshooting steps. Intent : This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to take screenshots on a Dell Chromebook.\nStep 1: Launch your Dell Chromebook and click the Start button, which is located in the lower left corner of the screen.\nStep 2: At the bottom of the Start menu, click on the Screenshots icon. It looks like a rectangle with a camera inside.\nStep 3: You will then see a crosshairs cursor on your screen. This is how you will select which area of the screen you want to capture.\nStep 4: Move the cursor to the area of the screen you want to capture and click the left mouse button. This will select the area.\nStep 5: Once the area is selected, the screenshot will automatically be saved to your local storage. You can find it in the Files app.\nStep 6: To take successive screenshots, press the Ctrl+switch (or Ctrl+F5) button on your keyboard, and then follow the above steps.\n1. Introduction to Chromebooks Once launched, a Chromebook has a different layout than a standard Windows or Mac computer. The main page is called the Launcher, and all apps on the machine are accessed through this. A button in the bottom left corner of the Launcher looks like a circle with a start icon inside of it – this is the Start button. After clicking it, a menu pops up that contains all of the features and applications that make up the Chromebook. In this menu, use the cursor to hover over the Screenshot icon, which is a rectangle with a camera in it. This will open the screenshot selection tool. From here, you can select the crosshairs cursor that appears on the screen and drag it to the area desired to be captured. After releasing the mouse button, a screenshot will be taken and saved to the computer.\n2. Overview of Screenshots on a Dell Chromebook The user can then select what area of the screen that they would like to take a screenshot by clicking and dragging the cursor with the mouse. To capture the screenshot, the user will need to press the Ctrl and Window Switcher keys at the same time. The screenshot will then be saved to the Downloads folder in the Chromebook. To locate the screenshot, the user should click on the Launcher icon located at the bottom left corner of the screen. The user can then open the Downloads folder to view the saved screenshot. Additionally, users can also copy the screen capture to the clipboard by pressing the Ctrl and Show All Windows keys. 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Taking Screenshots The next step is to press the Ctrl + Show windows key combination. This will enable a full screen capture and will start the editing mode. Once in this mode, users can crop the screenshot by dragging the corner points of the picture. When finished, click the save icon in the top right corner and select a suitable location to save the image.\nAfter exiting the editing mode, users can select the desired window to be captured by using the crosshairs cursor. Drag a box around the part of the window that is to be captured and the image will be taken. The captured image can then be edited in the same way as above.\nIn addition, users may also choose to take a picture of a particular area of the screen. This is done by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + Show windows combination. A selection box will appear, allowing users to drag and select the particular area of the screen they want to take a picture of.\nLastly, users have the option to capture and save the entire displayed screen. This is done by pressing the Ctrl + Alt + Show windows key combination. The image captured will consist of the content from all available tabs that are open at that time.\nUsers can also adjust the resolution of the screenshot when they open the save dialog box. The higher the resolution, the better the quality will be but this will also require a larger file size. By default, the screenshots are saved in the PNG format which is a good choice for images that need to be shared online.\n4. Summary Next, users should select the portion of the screen they wish to take a screenshot of. The cursor will transform into a crosshairs shape when the user clicks, which can then be dragged to select the desired area. After drawing the selection, the user should adjust the screenshot size by resizing the selection box. Once the desired size is selected, click Capture to take the screenshot.
