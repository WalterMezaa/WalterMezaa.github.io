Description Using the Windows 10 keyboard shortcut will allow you to take more than just full-screen screenshots. You can take snapshots of individual windows, areas of the screen, the whole desktop and more. To do this, simply hold down the Windows key and press the PrtScn button. Windows will then take a snapshot and save it to a new folder called “Screenshots” in your Pictures directory. This saves you time from having to manually take a screenshot and then save it to a separate folder. You can also use Alt + PrtScn to take a snapshot of just the active window. This is especially useful when you want to quickly capture a specific part of the screen without having to take a full-screen shot. Furthermore, you can also use the Windows + Shift + S shortcut to take a partial screenshot. This will open up a box on your screen that you can select an area of, allowing you to take a more precise screenshot. Once you select the area you want to capture, Windows will automatically save it to the “Screenshots” folder.\nII. How to Take a Screenshot on Windows 10 To start, open the window you wish to capture. Then, press the Windows key + PrtScn on your keyboard. If you’d like to capture an active window (open program or menu) instead, press Alt + PrtScn. The screenshot is automatically saved to your “Screenshots” folder in the Pictures library. Now, you can open the image in any photo viewing tool, like Paint, and edit it. You can also access the screen clipping by pressing Windows key + PrtScn or Alt + PrtScn again. After that, the screenshot will be copied to your clipboard, which you can paste into any image-editing program. III. Different Keyboard Shortcut Options The Windows 10 keyboard shortcuts for screenshots make it incredibly easy to capture whatever’s on your screen. Windows allows you to capture a full-screen, an active window, or a selective region of the screen. You can even change what happens when the screenshot is taken, which makes it ideal for capturing images quickly and easily. To take a screenshot in Windows 10, simply press the Windows key and PrtScn (Print Screen) to capture the full-screen, or Alt + PrtScn to capture an active window and save it to the “Screenshots” folder. Another way to take screenshots in Windows 10 is to use the Snipping Tool. It stays in the taskbar until you close it and allows you to capture the entire screen, an active window, or a square. You can also save the screenshot as a file, copy it to the clipboard, or save it as an HTML page. If you’re using more than one monitor, you can also use the Windows + Shift + S keyboard shortcut to capture a region of the screen. This will then open up the snipping tools menu where you can capture a specific area of the screen and with the delay function, you’ll have four seconds to switch back to the screen you want to capture before it takes the screenshot. Finally, if you have an Xbox Game Bar installed, you can also use the Win + Alt + PrtScn shortcut to take a screenshot and save it to the “Videos” folder.\nIV. Tips to Enhance Your Screenshot Taking Ability You can also adjust the Screenshots folder location to store your screenshots in different places. To do this, open the Settings and type “screenshots” to find the “Save my captures to” option. You can change this location to anywhere on your computer.\nWindows also offers a snipping tool for more control when taking screenshots. To open it, type “Snipping Tool” in the Start menu and click the result. This allows for a more precise selection of what you want to capture and can make taking screenshots of smaller objects easier.\nTo capture a specific area of the screen, you can hold down the Windows key and press Shift + S. This will open an interface that lets you select the area you want to screenshot. You can draw directly on the screenshot or annotate it with highlights, draw arrows, and more.\nA nice hidden feature of the Windows 10 screenshot keyboard shortcut is that it uses the default capture tool. This means that the buttons you would normally find in the Snipping Tool are also available with the keyboard shortcut. To access these options, press Windows Key + Shift + S.\nYou can use the screenshot keyboard shortcut to copy to the clipboard as well. This allows you to take a screenshot and then paste it into any application directly. To do this, press Windows Key + Ctrl + PrtScn. The image is now saved to your clipboard and can be pasted into any application.\nYou can also use the keyboard shortcut to save a screenshot to a specific application. For example, press Windows Key + Alt + PrtScn to save a screenshot directly to Microsoft Paint.\nQ1. What is a screenshot? A1.
