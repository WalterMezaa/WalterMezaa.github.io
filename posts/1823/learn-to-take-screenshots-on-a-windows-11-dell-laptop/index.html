This will capture the entire screen. If you only want to capture the active window, press Alt + Print Screen instead.\nStep 3: Open the Paint Program Open the Paint program, which can be found within the Windows Accessories folder.\nStep 4: To Paste a Screenshot Go to the Paint program, and press Ctrl + V or select Edit \u003e Paste from the top menu. This will paste the screenshot that you took.\nStep 5: Save Your Screenshot Click File \u003e Save As and save your screenshot in the desired format.

Understand the Basics of Taking a Screenshot Taking a screenshot is a relatively easy task to accomplish on a Windows 11 Dell laptop. To begin, press and hold the Windows key and then simultaneously press the Print Screen key. This will capture the entire display of your Dell laptop. The captured image will be stored in a folder which can be viewed in the Photos app. Additionally, you can also paste the screenshot directly into any program such as Microsoft Word or Paint. To do so, press the Windows key and the Print Screen key at the same time and then paste in the appropriate program. If you want to capture only part of the screen, press the Windows key, Shift key, and the S key. This will prompt a cursor that will allow you to highlight and capture a certain area of the screen. The screenshot will then be automatically saved in the same folder as the full screenshots. Finally, you can also take screenshots using the Snipping Tool. To access this, press the Windows key and then search for the Snipping Tool. Choose the type of snip you want to take and then click on the “New” button to select the area of your screen you wish to capture. Once done, click the “Save” button to save the screenshot in the desired location.\n2. Learn How to Cut and Paste Your Screenshot onto Another File Once you have captured your Dell laptop’s entire display, you can easily cut and paste it onto another file. To do so, simply open the image capturing program on your Dell laptop, select the screenshot you have taken, click on the ‘Edit’ icon, then choose the ‘Cut’ option. This will cut the screenshot out of the image editor and allow you to paste the image on any document or file. You can also copy the screenshot, which will create a duplicate of the same image.

If you need to capture just a small portion of the screen, pressing the Windows key and “Shift” key with the “S” brings up an option to draw and capture the area that is most important to you. Lastly, you can also capture all the opened windows (for example to list all the programs you have opened) by pressing the Windows key and the “T” key. This will result in a screenshot with all the programs listed for you.\n4.

To keep the screenshot intact, remember to save it in a different folder.\nIf you want to take a screenshot of an area, press the Windows + Shift + S keys. Your screen will dim and a cursor appears, which you can use to drag and take a screenshot of the desired area. After you take a screenshot, a notification will appear at the bottom-right corner of the screen that allows you to copy the capture and access the screenshot from the clipboard.\nYou can also use the Windows Game Bar to capture a screenshot. Press Windows+G to open the Windows Game Bar and click the camera icon on the bar, which will allow you to take a screenshot that will be automatically saved in the Captures folder. You can locate this folder inside the ‘Videos’ library.\nMoreover, to enhance your screenshot, you can open the screenshot with the Photos app. On the top ribbon, click ‘Edit and Create’ to access the editing tools. The editing tools include cropping, filtering, and enhancing the photo fade and contrast. Additionally, you can also draw and add text to the screenshot.\nFinally, to save your screenshot to different formats, right-click on the screenshot to access the ‘Save as’ option. You can save the screenshot as a .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, or Bitmap. Select the format of the image you want and click ‘Save’ and your screenshot will be saved in the selected format.\nQ1: What is a screenshot?
