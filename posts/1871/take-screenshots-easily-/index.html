The Power button is usually located on the right side of the phone. The Home button is generally a physical button at the middle of the phone.\nStep 3: You will hear a shutter sound and see a quick animation on your phone if the screenshot is taken successfully. The screenshot will be stored in the Photo Gallery app on your phone.\nStep 4: To access the screenshot, open the Photo Gallery app and you will find it in the Screenshots folder.\n1. Introduction to Android Screenshots Android screenshots can be taken easily without using the volume buttons. All you need to do is to unlock your Android Phone and you are ready to capture the desired screen. Then, press and hold the Power and Home buttons together until you hear a shutter sound. This indicates the screenshot has been taken and stored in your device’s memory. To access the screenshots, open the File Manager app and navigate to the DCIM/Screenshots folder. You can also view the screenshots on any image editing app or even share them directly via social media. Furthermore, if you want to delete the screenshots, simply go to the Screenshots folder again and delete the desired screenshots.\n2. Benefits of Taking Screenshots without using Volume Button Taking screenshots without using volume buttons is a convenient way to capture the desired data on the screen. It is also a safe way to capture screenshots, as some phones have a hardware problem when the volume button is pressed frequently. Additionally, users don’t need to press the power button and the volume button at the same time which could become quite uncomfortable. Moreover, this will save time as users don’t have to locate the volume buttons. Users will not need to fumble around with the buttons to capture the desired item on the screen. Furthermore, users don’t need to worry about accidentally pressing other device buttons while trying to take the screenshot. 3. Different Ways of Taking Screenshots without Volume Button For Android 7 or later versions: You can take screenshots by pressing and holding the Power and Volume Down Buttons at the same time. On certain devices with a physical home button, press the Power and Home Buttons at the same time instead.\nIf you don’t have a physical home button or capacitive buttons for navigation, you can make use of the Google Assistant instead. You can wake it up by long pressing the home button or saying “Hey Google/Ok Google”. Then just say “Take a screenshot” and the Google Assistant will take the screenshot of what you’re looking at.\nIf you’re using a Samsung device with the One UI software, you can double press the power key to take a screenshot. You also have the option to customize this action to other actions like opening the camera or launching a specific app.\nThird-party apps like Screenshot Easy or Screenshot Touch can also be installed on your Android smartphone to easily capture screenshots. These apps provide several features like multiple captures, a crop tool, a scrollbar to capture long screenshots and more.\nYou can also use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your computer to take screenshots if your smartphone is rooted. ADB can also be used to capture the screenshot of an app on your device from your computer.\nAnother way to take screenshots on Android phones is to connect it to a PC and use the default screenshot key combination of the PC. Almost all PCs will take a screenshot by pressing the Print Screen (PrtSc) button on the keyboard.\n4.
