Pattern lock screen is the most commonly used type, as it allows you to easily draw a pattern to unlock your device. PIN is a 4-digit numerical code, which is more secure than the pattern lock screen. Password is a complex combination of numbers and letters that makes guessing impossible. Once you decide which type of lock screen you will use, you can set it up in the settings. To do this, go to Settings \u003e Security \u003e Screen Lock. Select your preferred lock screen type and follow the on-screen instructions to set it up.\n2. Prepare the Necessary Tools Before starting to remove Android pattern lock, it is important to prepare all the necessary tools. These tools should include a laptop or a computer, a USB cable, and a memory card. Make sure that the laptop and the memory card do not contain any viruses or malware, as this could cause further damage to the device.

Choose the one you want to use, then click “Continue”. Your pattern lock will be changed.\nIf you want to remove the pattern lock without entering your PIN or password, go back to the Security \u0026 Location option. Select “Screen Lock”, then select “None”. Your pattern lock will be removed.\nIf you need to reset your pattern lock, go back to the Security \u0026 Location option. Select “Screen Lock”, then select “Forgot Pattern”. You will be asked to enter your Google Account information. Once you enter your details, you will be able to set a new pattern lock.\nIf you want to lock your device using a different method, select the “Screen Lock” option and choose from one of the available options.
