In this article, we will discuss some of the ways we can troubleshoot and fix the issue of taking screenshots on your ThinkPad Lenovo Laptop. So, let’s get started and learn the tips you need to take the perfect screenshots!\nAccording to Lenovo’s official website, “Taking a screenshot on ThinkPad laptops is a simple task. All you need is a combination of the Print Screen and Fn keys, plus the Windows key.” Additionally, the main reasons why people may be having trouble taking screenshots on their Lenovo ThinkPad laptop could be because they don’t have the right combination of keys, they don’t have the latest Windows Updates, or they don’t have the right tool installed (such as the Snipping Tool). For easy troubleshooting, Lenovo suggests that users press the “Fn + Space Bar + Windows Key” combination for a quick and easy screenshot. This should suffice in most cases to take a full screenshot of the active window or the entire screen.

Then open an image editor like Microsoft Paint or Adobe Photoshop, press Ctrl and V keys to paste the screenshot. You can also use the screenshot snipping tool in Windows 10 to create a screenshot with limited capture area.\n4. Save the screenshot to the required location. When you take a screenshot, the image is saved as a .png file in the Screenshots folder, which is located in the Pictures folder. You can rename the file and save it to any other location like a Windows or cloud storage folder. To save it to a different location, select Save as from the File menu.
